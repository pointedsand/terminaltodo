# Terminal Todo (deprecated)

A WIP to-do list program written in C using ncurses terminal manipulation. 

Currently has full functionality except for removing tasks from the list.

**Work is no longer being done on this as I'm starting a new CLI todo-app with better functionality and support with a custom C http server.**
